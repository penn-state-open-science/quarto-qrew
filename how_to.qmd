## Render Quarto site

From the terminal, execute the following:

```
quarto render
```

Here are more tips about rendering: <https://quarto.org/docs/computations/caching.html#rendering>.

## Change default output directory

GitHub Pages prefers that website outputs live in the project's root directory or in `docs/`.

We need to change the default output as follows.
Edit the `_quarto.yml` file:

```
project:
  type: website
  render:
    - index.qmd
    - goals.qmd
    - how_to.qmd
  output-dir: docs
```

:::{.callout-note}

We need to create `docs/` before rendering the site, of course.
We'll leave `_site/` in place since it is the default for `output-dir`.

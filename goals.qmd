This page describes the goals of the Quarto Qrew.

Initially, we're setting our our goals as individuals.

## Rick Gilmore {#rick-gilmore}

- How Quarto [websites](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) and [books](https://quarto.org/docs/books/) compare to `bookdown`.
    - How do I change the default output directory to `docs/` for use with GitHub pages?
- Should I migrate my [PSYCH 490 course](https://psu-psychology.github.io/psych-490-reproducibility-2023-spring/) for Fall 2023 to Quarto?
- Should we migrate the Open Science Bootcamp 2023 [site](https://penn-state-open-science.github.io/bootcamp-2023/index.html) to Quarto?
- What should a workshop on R Markdown/RStudio/Quarto for the Bootcamp look like?
- Should I keep using Quarto within RStudio or move to VSCode?
